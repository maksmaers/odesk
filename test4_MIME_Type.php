MIME is used in numerous internet protocols to associate a media type (html, image, video ...) with the content sent. The MIME type is generally inferred from the extension of the file to be sent.
You must write a program that makes it possible to detect a MIME type using the file name.
 
 
You are given a table which provides the association of MIME types and file extensions. You will also be given a list of file names to be transferred and you must deduce, for each one of these files, the MIME type to be used.

If it is not possible to find the MIME type corresponding to a file, or if the file doesnâ€™t have an extension, display UNKNOWN.
 
INPUT:
Line 1: Number N of elements which make up the table of association.
Line 2: Number Q of file names to be analyzed.
N following lines : One file extension per line and the corresponding MIME type (separated by a blank space).
Q following lines : One file name per line.
 
OUTPUT:
For each of the Q nilenames, display on a line the corresponding MIME type. If there is no corresponding type, then display UNKNOWN.
 
CONSTRAINTS:
0 < N < 10000
0 < Q < 10000

    File extensions are composed of maximum 10 alphanumerical ASCII characters.
    MIME types are composed of maximum 50 alphanumerical ASCII characters and punctuations.
    File names are composed of maximum 256 alphanumerical ASCII characters and dots (full stops).
    here are no spaces in the file names, extensions and MIME types.

 
EXAMPLE:
Input

4
html text/html
png image/png
test.html

portrait.png
doc.TXT
Output
