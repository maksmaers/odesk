Here is the encoding principle:

    The input message consists of ASCII characters (7-bit)
    The encoded output message consists of blocks of 0
    A block is separated from another block by a space
    Two consecutive blocks are used to produce a series of same value bits (only 1s or 0s):
        First block: it is always 0 or 00. If it is 0, then the series contains 1s, if not, it contains 0s
        Second block: the number of 0s in this block is the number of bits in the series

Let’s take a simple example with a message which consists of only one character: Capital C. C in binary is represented as 1000011, so with Chuck Norris’ technique this gives:

    0 0 (the first series consists of only a single 1)
    00 0000 ((the second series consists of four 0)
    0 00 (the third consists of two 1)

So C is coded as: 0 0 00 0000 0 00

Second example, we want to encode the message CC (i.e. the 14 bits 10000111000011) :

    0 0 (one single 1)
    00 0000 (four 0)
    0 000 (three 1)
    00 0000 (four 0)
    0 00 (two 1)

So CC is coded as: 0 0 00 0000 0 000 00 0000 0 00

Write a program that takes an incoming message as input and displays as output the message encoded using Chuck Norris’ method.
INPUT:
Line 1: the message consisting of N ASCII characters (without carriage return)
 
OUTPUT:
The encoded message
 
CONSTRAINTS :
0 < N < 100
 
EXAMPLE :
Input
C
Output
0 0 00 0000 0 00
