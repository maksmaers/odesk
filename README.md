Task #1
In this exercise, you have to analyze records of temperature to find the closest to zero.

 
Sample temperatures. Here, -1 is the closest to 0.

Write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among input data.

INPUT:
Line 1: N, the number of temperatures to analyse
Line 2: The N temperatures expressed as integers ranging from -273 to 5526

OUTPUT:

    Display 0 (zero) if no temperature is provided
    Otherwise, display the temperature closest to 0, knowing that if two numbers are equally close to zero, positive integer has to be considered closest to zero (for instance, if the temperatures are -5 to 5, then display 5)


CONSTRAINTS:
0 â‰¤ N < 10000

EXAMPLE:
Input
5
1 -2 -8 4 5
Output
1
Available RAM : 512MB
Timeout: 6 seconds

    The program has to read inputs from standard input
    The program has to write the solution to standard output
    The program must run in the test environment
